# EucalyptusPool
Eucalyptus Cardano stake pool
The Eucalyptus Stake Pool is inspired by Sir David Attenborough and Charles Darwin promoting the ecosystem of forests and climate action.

Catastrophic climate change is happening before our eyes before it is too late if we can urgently we must do our part, the eucalyptus pool ambition is to educate, inspire and contribute to the climate action and invest in climate tech in this direction we making steps and have projects planned in pipeline. Please delegate to the pool so a tiny percentage of the rewards will be invested in a treasury for the cause.
